What I created was a landing page for our SAM experiences page. I used 5 files total. Our index page with the CSS and javascript connected. The team page with it's CSS. I used a combination of normal HTML and CSS with some bootstrap here and there. I used JS to create the tabs found at the bottom of the index page.
