"Pitch: Many stay home moms report feeling 'stir crazy' and their social needs are not met. Enter ABC experience (Think AirBNB experiences...but for stay at home moms) . People can host an experience, and earn money leading people on activities they love. Itâ€™s an opportunity for anyone to share their hobbies, skills, or expertise. The basic premise is to emulate Airbnb experiences, but instead of targeting tourists traveling to a new area, one targets stay-at-home moms.
 
 For the MVP Create:
 
 1. An on-boarding process for a new general user (user that will consume the service)
 2. On-boarding process for user who wants to generate content (i.e. organize experiences for other local stay-at-home moms)
 3. profile page for users.
 4. Ability to easily create / setup an experience
 5. Ability to easily edit / delete an experience
 6. Ability to easily search / find experience through title, dates, location, and price filters
 7. Home page to see available experiences for general user
 
 Stretch: Allow user to set an availability schedule for each experience, whether that's daily, weekly, or monthly.

## **Your primary role User Interface Developer:**

You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build. Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building. Your marketing website must be hosted.

For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is working on. Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key. For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another's socials/Github.
