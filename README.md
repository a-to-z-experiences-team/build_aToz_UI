# build_aToz_UI

"Pitch: Many stay home moms report feeling 'stir crazy' and their social needs are not met. Enter ABC experience (Think AirBNB experiences...but for stay at home moms) . People can host an experience, and earn money leading people on activities they love. Itâ€™s an opportunity for anyone to share their hobbies, skills, or expertise. The basic premise is to emulate Airbnb experiences, but instead of targeting tourists traveling to a new area, one targets stay-at-home moms.
 
 For the MVP Create:
 
 1. An on-boarding process for a new general user (user that will consume the service)
 2. On-boarding process for user who wants to generate content (i.e. organize experiences for other local stay-at-home moms)
 3. profile page for users.
 4. Ability to easily create / setup an experience
 5. Ability to easily edit / delete an experience
 6. Ability to easily search / find experience through title, dates, location, and price filters
 7. Home page to see available experiences for general user
 
 Stretch: Allow user to set an availability schedule for each experience, whether that's daily, weekly, or monthly.
